# Server_Python

Several wholesalers of (food) products have decided to create a universal system for handling catalogs of their products
- the system is to be created for customers who would like to be able to check the prices of certain products in a
selected wholesaler.

Each warehouse has its own (single) server storing a catalog of the products it offers, and the method of storing
information differs between different types of servers. Moreover, as each wholesaler may use different designations for
the same products, there is no common product database.

The system is not intended to connect all servers into one network, but to enable its effective implementation in each
of the warehouses (separately). Therefore, it should be designed in such a way as to take into account the diversity of
the representation of the product catalog within the server in individual warehouses. In particular, wholesalers should
be able to obtain the desired information without knowing how the product catalog is represented on a particular server.
